#### Description:

Hello, my name is Emil, and I’m excited to share my project with you: Moby-Dick Text Analysis. This project is a web application I built using Flask and the CS50 library, designed to analyze and explore the text of Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick. It provides tools to examine word frequencies, identify alliterations, and locate specific words in context, making it both an educational tool and an engaging way to interact with a literary classic.

The application offers three key features, each designed to highlight different aspects of textual analysis. The first feature is a word frequency tool. By leveraging an SQLite database, the app tracks how often each word appears in the text of Moby-Dick. On the app’s search page, users can sort and filter through the database to identify frequently used words or uncover rarer ones. For example, it’s easy to find common words like “whale” or “sea,” but you can also explore less frequent terms to see how they contribute to the text.

The second feature focuses on contextual word occurrences. This tool allows users to search for any word in the text and returns up to 10 sentences where the word appears. Each result includes surrounding sentences for context, making it easier to understand how the word is used in different parts of the book. For instance, if you search for the word “storm,” the app will display sentences from various chapters where “storm” is mentioned, along with its broader narrative context. This feature is particularly useful for studying themes, motifs, or recurring imagery within the novel.

The third and most distinctive feature of the app is the alliteration finder. This tool scans the text to identify three-word alliterations, where all three words start with the same letter. Using Python’s re module, the app filters out trivial or short words and focuses on meaningful alliterative phrases. Each result includes the chapter number and the full sentence in which the alliteration occurs, providing users with a deeper appreciation for Melville’s use of language. For example, the app might highlight phrases like “whale-watching waves” or “brilliant blue birds” (if such phrases existed in the text). This feature not only showcases the richness of Melville’s prose but also demonstrates how computational tools can uncover patterns in literature.

From a technical perspective, this project integrates multiple tools and programming techniques to create a seamless experience. The app’s backend is built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework that handles routing and dynamic content generation. The SQLite database stores the preprocessed word frequency data, allowing for efficient querying and sorting on the frontend. Python’s regular expression library (re) plays a central role in text analysis, enabling the app to split sentences, filter words, and search for patterns such as alliterations. For example, the find_3_word_alliterations function processes sentences in the text to locate three consecutive words starting with the same letter, while the find_occurrences function extracts relevant sentences containing a given word.

The app also leverages Flask routes like /search and /alliterations to connect the backend logic with user-facing pages. The /search route retrieves word frequency data from the database and presents it in a sortable and searchable table. Meanwhile, the /alliterations route displays the results of the alliteration analysis, providing users with a detailed view of linguistic patterns in the text. These routes ensure that users can interact with the app intuitively, without needing to understand the underlying code.

In terms of design, the app prioritizes simplicity and usability. The homepage introduces users to the available features, while individual pages focus on specific tasks such as searching for word frequencies or exploring alliterations. Although the current interface is functional, I see significant opportunities for improvement, such as incorporating interactive visualizations or enhancing the overall aesthetic of the site.

Looking ahead, there are several ways I plan to expand this project. One idea is to adapt the app to analyze other classic texts, such as Pride and Prejudice or The Great Gatsby. This would demonstrate how the same tools can be applied across different literary works. Additionally, I want to include data visualizations that show trends in word frequency or highlight recurring themes across chapters. For instance, a graph could illustrate how often the word “whale” appears in each chapter, providing insights into the structure of the narrative. Finally, I aim to improve the user interface to make the app more engaging and accessible for a wider audience.

This project represents the intersection of my interests in programming, literature, and data analysis. It has been a rewarding experience to combine these fields into a single application that is both educational and interactive. By working on this app, I gained hands-on experience with Flask, SQLite, and Python’s text processing capabilities, while also exploring how technology can be used to analyze and appreciate literature in new ways.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my project. If you’re interested in exploring the app further, the code is available on my GitHub, and I encourage you to try it out for yourself. I look forward to continuing to develop this project and exploring new possibilities for combining technology and the humanities.
